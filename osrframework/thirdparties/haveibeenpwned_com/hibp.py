    Method that checks if the given email is stored in the HIBP website.

    This function automatically waits a second to avoid problems with the API

In October 2013, 153 million Adobe accounts were breached with each containing an internal ID, username, email, <em>encrypted</em> password and a password hint in plain text. The password cryptography was poorly done and <a href=\"http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt\" target=\"_blank\">many were quickly resolved back to plain text</a>. The unencrypted hints also <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/adobe-credentials-and-serious.html\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed much about the passwords</a> adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.","DataClasses":["Email addresses","Password hints","Passwords","Usernames"]}]
