The unencrypted hints also <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/adobe-credentials-and-serious.html\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed much about the passwords</a> adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.","DataClasses":["Email addresses","Password hints","Passwords","Usernames"]}]
